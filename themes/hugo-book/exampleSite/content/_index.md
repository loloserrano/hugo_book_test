# Frugging KCP

This project is a postmodern analysis of gender in Knapp, Crystal, and Prince’s Problems in Contract Law: Cases and Materials. Problems in Contract Law is an American contracts casebook that attempts, in good faith and with a commercial incentive, to relay the current state and relevant history of American contract law to first-year law students. The opinions 

This is a descriptive project, but is necessarily political, and comes with a heavy normative undertone. This project compares the ways in which women, as a political population, appear in the casebook differently from men. Most Americans expected women not to participate in the government or the formal economy from the country’s inception to the early twentieth century, and not to occupy public positions of capitalist power until the middle of the twentieth century. There is a massive historical disparity in the relative power of women in public   (again, as a political population) and men (the same), that is slowly edging towards parity according mostly to economic metrics. 

For better or worse, the casebook does represent this dynamic. This is not a total denunciation of the casebook editors’ choices. Presenting these inequalities accurately reflects the general exclusion of women from public life and contracts law for most of American history. The limited universe of American contracts presented in a this casebook provide an interesting venue to examine a snapshot of flawed, gendered, improving, complicated law.

Ea _furtique_ risere fratres edidit terrae magis. Colla tam mihi tenebat:
miseram excita suadent es pecudes iam. Concilio _quam_ velatus posset ait quod
nunc! Fragosis suae dextra geruntur functus vulgata.
