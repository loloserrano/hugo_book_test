# Frugging KCP


This project is a postmodern analysis of gender in Knapp, Crystal, and Prince’s *Problems in Contract Law: Cases and Materials.* *Problems in Contract Law* is an American contracts casebook that attempts, in good faith and with a commercial incentive, to relay the current state and relevant history of American contract law to first-year law students. The opinions 

This is a descriptive project, but is necessarily political, and comes with a heavy normative undertone. This project compares the ways in which women, as a political population, appear in the casebook differently from men. Most Americans expected women not to participate in the government or the formal economy from the country’s inception to the early twentieth century, and not to occupy public positions of capitalist power until the middle of the twentieth century. There is a massive historical disparity in the relative power of women in public   (again, as a political population) and men (the same), that is slowly edging towards parity according mostly to economic metrics. 

For better or worse, the casebook does represent this dynamic. This is not a total denunciation of the casebook editors’ choices. Presenting these inequalities accurately reflects the general exclusion of women from public life and contracts law for most of American history. The limited universe of American contracts presented in a this casebook provide an interesting venue to examine a snapshot of flawed, gendered, improving, complicated law.

## Table of Contents

### Queering Frug's Feminism

In this section I describe the purpose, framework, and theory of this project. I detail the work of Mary Joe Frug on which this project is based and introduce new ideas, both from her other pieces and from later work, that complicate the idea of gender. 

### The Cases

In this section I describe my data collecting process, the scope of the cases, and some basic preliminary information breaking down the dataset. 

### The Characters

In this section I explore the individual humans who appear in the casebook as characters, understood, framed, and described by judges and casebook editors. Most of my focus in the section is on women, who appear as a minority of characters and in a strictly limited set of roles. Most strikingly, over half of the women appear in the litigation with a heterosexual partner; nearly another quarter of the women appear with another family member. 

### Masculine Businesses

In this section I explore general notions of masculinity and femininity as they appear in the casebook. The most striking pattern here is the significant number of businesses with masculine sounding names.
