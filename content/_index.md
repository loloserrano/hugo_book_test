# Frugging KCP


This project analyzes gender in Knapp, Crystal, and Prince’s *Problems in Contract Law: Cases and Materials.* This project is directly inspired by Mary Joe Frug's "Re-Reading Contracts: A Feminist Analysis of a Contracts Casebook.""

It aims to explore two basic, descriptive questions: 
1. How do women appear in the casebook differently from men? 
2. How do abstract gendered ideas appear in the casebook? 

### Gender Inequality

While I will get deeper into the question of what exactly a woman or man *is* in the section Re-Reading Contracts and Updating Frug, this project is predicated on the idea that for most of American history people have been 

Most Americans expected women not to participate in the government or the formal economy from the country’s inception to the early twentieth century, and not to occupy public positions of capitalist power until the middle of the twentieth century. There is a massive historical disparity in the relative power of women in public (again, as a political population) and men (the same), that is slowly edging towards parity according mostly to economic metrics. 

For better or worse, the casebook does represent this dynamic. Presenting these inequalities accurately reflects the general exclusion of women from public life and contracts law for most of American history. The limited universe of American contracts presented in a this casebook provide an interesting venue to examine a snapshot of flawed, gendered, improving, complicated law.

## Re-Reading Contracts and Updating Frug

In this section I describe the purpose, framework, and theory of this project. I detail the work of Mary Joe Frug on which this project is based and introduce new ideas, both from her other pieces and from later work, that update the gender theory and legal perspective. 

## On Style
This section is a bit of an aside - I explain my use of Fruggish and Frugging. 

## The Cases: An Overview
In this section I describe some overall patterns in the dataset. 

## The Characters: Wives, Widows, Workers
In this section I describe my data collecting process, the scope of the cases, and some basic preliminary information breaking down the dataset. 
### Wives
One of the most interesting gendered patterns in the casebook was the massive proportion of women who were married or otherwise appeared with family members. 
### Widows
Three women appeared not *with* husbands, but specifically *without* them - there are three sad, old widows in the book, all of whom are posed (whether by the judges or the editors) as vulnerable and taken advantage of. 
### Workers
Very few women specifically appeared as workers, but there were some groups of workers that did not have a gender specifically attributed to them but were likely men.

## The Characteristics: He's a Business, Man
In this section I explore general notions of masculinity and femininity as they appear in the casebook. The most striking pattern here is the significant number of businesses with masculine sounding names.
