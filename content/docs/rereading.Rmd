# The Goal of this Project

*Frugging KCP* applies Mary Joe Frug's methods in "Re-Reading Contracts: A Feminist Analysis of a Contracts Casebook" to Knapp, Crystal, and Prince's *Problems in Contract Law: Cases and Materials* (KCP).

This project describes the way that KCP represents gender. Most of the individuals who appears in the cases have one of two discernible binary genders: man or woman. Interestingly, several of the businesses have names that suggest gender - usually masculine - as well. There are substantial qualitative and quantitative differences in the men and the women in the casebook.

## "Re-Reading Contracts"

Frug's "Re-Reading Contracts" is a thorough review of Dawson, Harvey, and Henderson's *Cases and Comment on Contracts* (4th ed. 1982). 

> "My objective is critical in character, for I believe a feminist analysis should change one's consciousness."

> "First, I want to demonstrate that readers' views about gender affect their understanding of a law casebook. Second, I want to demonstrate that gendered aspects of a casebook affect readers' understanding of the law and of themselves." 

### "Women as characters"

### "Abstract characteristics"  

## Postmodernism

**Language** is a major factor in the way identities are formed, maintained, and empowered or subjugated. 


## Critical Legal Studies

## Queer

> *I use "gender" to mean the reductive, dualistic classification of an array of social and psychological characteristics according to biological sex.* 

Later on in her career, Frug developed a more complicated view of "biological sex" than what she displays  In her last public work "A Postmodern Feminist Legal Manifesto (An Unfinished Draft)," she offered a definition: 

> *Sex differences are semiotic - that is, constituted by a system of signs that we produce and interpret*
