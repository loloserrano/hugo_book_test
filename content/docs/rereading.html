<h1>The Goal of this Project</h1>
<p><em>Frugging KCP</em> applies Mary Joe Frug’s methods in “Re-Reading Contracts: A Feminist Analysis of a Contracts Casebook” to Knapp, Crystal, and Prince’s <em>Problems in Contract Law: Cases and Materials</em> (KCP).</p>
<p>This project describes the way that KCP represents gender. Most of the individuals who appears in the cases have one of two discernible binary genders: man or woman. Interestingly, several of the businesses have names that suggest gender - usually masculine - as well. There are substantial qualitative and quantitative differences in the men and the women in the casebook.</p>

<h2>“Re-Reading Contracts”</h2>
<p>Frug’s <a href="/readings/rereadingcontracts.pdf">“Re-Reading Contracts”</a> is a thorough review of Dawson, Harvey, and Henderson’s <em>Cases and Comment on Contracts</em> (4th ed. 1982). Frug</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“My objective is critical in character, for I believe a feminist analysis should change one’s consciousness.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“First, I want to demonstrate that readers’ views about gender affect their understanding of a law casebook. Second, I want to demonstrate that gendered aspects of a casebook affect readers’ understanding of the law and of themselves.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I use “gender” to mean the reductive, dualistic classification of an array of social and psychological characteristics according to biological sex.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later on in her career, Frug developed a more complicated view of “biological sex.” In her last public work “A Postmodern Feminist Legal Manifesto (An Unfinished Draft),” she offered a definition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Sex differences are semiotic - that is, constituted by a system of signs that we produce and interpret</em></p>
