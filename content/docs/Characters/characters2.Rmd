## Marriage and Family 

57% of the women in the casebook appear with (or regarding) a spouse or partner, as opposed to 19% of men. 13% of women are described regarding some other familiar relationship (aunt, sister, mother, etc.) as opposed to 10% of men. In all, nearly 3 of every 4 women are described by their familiar relations as opposed to less than a third of men. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

### The (Un)Happy Couples 

Most of these are members of one of the 24 couples who appeared with or against a heterosexual partner in a relationship. 


```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

couples1 <- couples %>%
  filter(couple == 1)
couples2 <- couples %>%
  filter(couple ==2)
couples3 <- couples %>%
  filter(couple == 3)
couples4 <- couples %>%
  filter(couple ==4)

couples_table <- couples1 %>%
  right_join(couples2,by=c("page","year","transaction","cite","simplecite")) %>%

## Relevant Non-Party Spouses

Two men and two women had their relationships described with reference to the proceedings but without their partner appearing. 

### Katz v. Danny Dare Inc.
#### 610 S.W.2d 121 (Mo. Ct. App. 1980)
#### KCP 248

I.G. Katz brought a promissory estoppel claim against a company the president of which “was also the brother of Katz’s wife,” establishing the connection between Katz and the company; moreover, his wife would benefit from a Social Security clause in the promised contract.

### Credit Bureau Enter. v. Pelo
#### 608 N.W.2d 20 (Iowa 2000)
#### KCP 297

Russell N. Pelo was involuntarily committed to a hospital after he telephoned his wife to make threats of self harm, relevant to the context of his refusal to pay. 

### Locke v. Warner Bros., Inc. 
#### 57 Cal. App. 4th 354 (1997)
#### KCP 513

Sondra Locke’s dispute with Warner Bros. is framed as something patronizingly set up for her by her ex Clint Eastwood (not a party), relevant to the argument about good faith.

### King v. Trustees of Boston Univ.
#### 420 Mass. 52 (1995)
#### KCP 237

Coretta Scott King brings her case on behalf of her family estate, and is actually a great example of rhetoric relating a woman to a husband but still giving her full agency: 

> *“The plaintiff, Coretta Scott King, in her capacity as administratix of the estate of her late husband, and in her individual capacity, appeals...”*

## Barely Relevant Non-Party Status. 

One man and one woman had their marital status described as a strange, but seemingly purposeful, aside. 

### Dohrmann v. Swaney
#### 14 N.E.3d 605 (Ill. 2014)
#### KCP 129

Dohrmann v. Swaney: “Dohrmann was a 40-year-old neurosurgeon, married to Dr. Helen Dohrmann” 130, where his and his wifes’ professional status establish a class level in this case about fraud? 

### Aceves v. U.S. Bank N.A.
#### 120 Cal. Rptr. 3d 507 (Cal. Ct. App. 2011)
#### KCP 255

In Aceves v. U.S. Bank, N.A. the judge present the plaintiff, a woman independently bringing a suit whose spouse appears only as a minor detail in the rest of the opinion, as “Claudia Aceves, a married woman.” (255) The case is about bankruptcy – perhaps her marriage establishes some kind of moral credibility?
